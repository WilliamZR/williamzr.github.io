I am a master student at Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://yansongfeng.github.io/). I currently work as research assistant at the University of Hongkong with [Prof. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). 

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Intergrated Science Program from Yuanpei College, Peking University. During my undergraduate study, I worked with [Prof. Chao Tang](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/tanglab/index.htm) at Quantitive Center of Biology. I worked on metabolic flux analysis of cyanobacteria and growth behavior of fisson yeast and budding yeast.


My research interests include question answering and scientific discovery for structured data, as well as planning with large language models.
