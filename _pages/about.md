I am a master student at Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://yansongfeng.github.io/). I previously work as research assistant at the University of Hong Kong with [Prof. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). 

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Intergrated Science Program from Yuanpei College, Peking University. During my undergraduate study, I worked with [Prof. Chao Tang](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/tanglab/index.htm) at Quantitive Center of Biology. I worked on metabolic flux analysis of cyanobacteria and growth behavior of fisson yeast and budding yeast.


My research currently focus on reinforcement learning with autoregressive LLMs and building diffusion language models.
